  From Job Shop  towards Smart Factory in stone processing industry
 
2.Use Case Description
  Enabling to respond quickly to customer needs and market changes while still controlling costs and quality.
  The experiment focuses on the connectivity and digitization of the production environment already including
advanced robot cells and CNC machines as well as non-digital equipment such as pallets. This transforms a job
shop to a smart agile factory, allowing to instantly change production. Each product can be different, and the
different products can be mixed in the production flow.

3.Proposed Solution
Connect the robots and their HMI with the OCB. Collect data about the production process. Run some smart 
factory services in order to make smart decisions on the shopfloor. Give feedback to the operator and management 
about the status and the progress of the production.
