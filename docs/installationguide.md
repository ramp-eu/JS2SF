All components necessary to do this are uploaded on the RAMP platform using the upload link between Renier and Optidrive. With every uploaded component ther is a short md file about the component and its installation.

We have to install following softwares to get the demo running :

On the VTT server :  see docker file + explanation over there about setting up the OCB, cratedb and quantumleap

In grafana : install the developped dahboards (is already done at the server). The 3 json file for this is on the ramp server.

On an IPC : HMI of the two robotic cells. 

Two Virtual robots. Each one on a separate PC.








At this moment the OCB is filled with data coming from our virtual robots. However it is not possible to generate simulation data for the robot without having the virtual robot up and running. 
If needed we can turn on the virtual robots for a while and start some programs running for some hours. During this time it is possible for you to investigate the behaviour of all the components od the demonstartion.
