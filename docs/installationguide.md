We have to install following softwares to get the demo running :
in grafana : 

On an IPC : HMI of the two robotic cells. 

Two Virtual robots. Each one on a separate PC.








At this moment the OCB is filled with data coming from our virtual robots. However it is not possible to generate simulation data for the robot without having the virtual robot up and running. 
If needed we can turn on the virtual robots for a while and start some programs running for some hours. During this time it is possible for you to investigate the behaviour of all the components od the demonstartion.
